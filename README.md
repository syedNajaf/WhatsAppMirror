For every app i build i used the MVC approach,there will no problem in maintainability,readability,scalability,testability and refactoring in
future if we used the MVC achitecture in building applications.
In this whatsAppMirror i learned the new feature of android that is pull to refresh,for this app also i used back4app parse server.
